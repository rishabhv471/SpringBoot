# Establishing a JDBC Connection to SQL

This branch demonstrates how to establish a JDBC connection from a Java application to a SQL database.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Review the code in this branch to understand how the JDBC connection is set up.
4. Make sure you have the necessary JDBC driver for your specific database. If not, download and configure it.
5. Update the database connection parameters in the code (e.g., URL, username, password) to match your database configuration.
6. Compile and run the application to establish a connection to your SQL database.
